Jonathan Goldsmith, the XX guys, needs to update the style of his 'i Beer' blog. His current blog has no styling whatsoever. 
He has provided you with a mockup and your job is to add styling to the current HTML.

Style the given HTML document to match the 'blog' mockup using the following:

- Positioning
- Z-index
- Flexbox
- Adjacent values

Fonts  

For this project we are using the 'Google fonts' API. We have already imported the fonts for you (see head). The fonts are:
- 'Josefin Sans'
- 'Noto Serif'
